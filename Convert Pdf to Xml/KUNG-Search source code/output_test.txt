If there is no Taiwanese, then the consequences can be 

imagined. In human history, we have always tried our best to

endlessly correcting it, unquestionable progress can be made in 

science. It's mind blowing. Obluchev famously said, we need 

truth, only truth. Never try to flatter your friends, 

accommodate your teachers, and never offend anyone. Even 

though you may find peace and tranquility along the way, you 

will never gain any fundamental benefit. This sentence made all 

my doubts suddenly clear
